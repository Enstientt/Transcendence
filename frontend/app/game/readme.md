### Sub-Steps for Game Core Development: 1 in Phaser with Arcade Physics

1. **Setting Up the Phaser Environment**
    - **Task**: Set up your Phaser development environment in Next.js.
        - [x]  Install Phaser (`npm install phaser`).
        - [x]  Initialize a new Phaser game instance (`new Phaser.Game(config)`).
    - **Outcome**: Ready Phaser environment.
    - **Phaser Functions**: `Phaser.Game()`
2. **Designing the Game Canvas**
    - **Task**: Configure the game canvas in Phaser.
        - [x]  Define the game type and size in the Phaser configuration object.
    - **Outcome**: Configured game canvas.
    - **Phaser Functions**: Game configuration in `Phaser.Game()`
3. **Creating Paddles and Ball**
    - **Task**: Create the paddles and the ball using Phaser.
        - [ ]  Preload assets (`this.load.image()`).
        - [ ]  Create sprites (`this.physics.add.sprite()`).
    - **Outcome**: Paddles and ball in the game.
    - **Phaser Functions**: `preload()`, `this.load.image()`, `this.physics.add.sprite()`

### **4. Implementing Movement Mechanics**

- **Task**: Implement paddle and ball movement.
    - Handle player input for paddles (**`this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys()`**).
    - Set initial ball movement (**`setVelocity()`**).
- **Outcome**: Movable game objects.
- **Implementation**:
    - **In `create`**: Set up initial ball velocity.
    - **In `update`**: Handle real-time paddle movement based on player input.
- **Achieved by**: Assigning velocity to the ball in **`create`** for initial movement. In **`update`**, continuously checking keyboard input to move the paddles.
- **Phaser Functions**: **`setVelocity()`**, **`this.input.keyboard`**

### **5. Adding Collision Detection**

- **Task**: Implement collision between the ball and paddles.
    - Use Arcade Physics for collision detection (**`this.physics.add.collider()`**).
- **Outcome**: Ball reacts to paddle collisions.
- **Implementation**:
    - **In `create`**: Set up the collider between ball and paddles.
- **Achieved by**: Creating a collider in **`create`** that automatically handles the physics of the ball bouncing off the paddles when they collide.
- **Phaser Functions**: **`this.physics.add.collider()`**

### **6. Creating a Scoring System**

- **Task**: Develop a system to track and update scores.
    - Implement logic to detect scoring conditions.
    - Update and display scores (**`this.add.text()`**).
- **Outcome**: Functional scoring system.
- **Implementation**:
    - **In `create`**: Set up text objects for displaying scores.
    - **In `update`**: Check if scoring conditions are met (like ball missing the paddle) and update the score.
- **Achieved by**: Using text objects to display scores on the screen and checking the ball's position each frame to update scores as needed.
- **Phaser Functions**: **`this.add.text()`**

### Note for Step 7 and 8

- We don’t want the ball to bounce off the world bound. There are two ways of fixing this.
1.  I can reset the ball quick enough so it does not look like it’s bouncing off and I can set the ball to bounce 1. 
2. I can create a top and bottom walls and and set them and the paddles to bounce and then theoretically only these bodies should trigger a bounce and the world ends should not. (Only explore if option 1 isn’t viable)

### **7. Fine-Tuning Game Physics**

- **Task**: Adjust game physics properties.
    - Modify physics properties like bounce and immovable objects (**`setBounce()`**, **`setImmovable()`**).
- **Outcome**: Balanced game physics.
- **Implementation**:
    - **In `create`**: Configure physics properties of game objects.
- **Achieved by**: Setting the bounce property of the ball for its interaction with paddles and walls, and making paddles immovable so they don't get displaced by the ball.
- **Phaser Functions**: **`setBounce()`**, **`setImmovable()`**

### **8. Establishing Game Boundaries**

- **Task**: Define game world boundaries.
    - Set boundaries for ball movement (**`setCollideWorldBounds()`**).
- **Outcome**: Defined game area.
- **Implementation**:
    - **In `create`**: Configure the ball to collide with the game world bounds.
    - **In `update`**: Optionally check if the ball has reached these bounds for scoring.
- **Achieved by**: Enabling the ball to collide with the game's world boundaries, thus preventing it from leaving the play area, and using these boundaries to determine scoring events.
- **Phaser Functions**: **`setCollideWorldBounds()`**
1. **Initial Testing and Debugging**
    - **Task**: Test and debug the game.
        - [ ]  Playtest and identify issues.
        - [ ]  Refine game mechanics based on testing.
    - **Outcome**: Debugged game prototype.
    - **Phaser Functions**: Testing and debugging tools, Console log, Phaser debug features
2. **Performance Optimization**
    - **Task**: Enhance game performance.
        - [ ]  Optimize rendering and physics calculations.
    - **Outcome**: Optimized game performance.
    - **Phaser Functions**: Performance analysis tools, Phaser settings for optimization
3. **Preparing for Next Steps**
    - **Task**: Assess the game's core and plan future features.
        - [ ]  Review current game mechanics.
        - [ ]  Plan for UI design and advanced features.
    - **Outcome**: Ready for further development.
    - **Phaser Functions**: Planning and review based on current game state

By focusing on these specific Phaser functions at each development stage, you can effectively build and enhance the core mechanics of your Pong game, leveraging the capabilities of Phaser's Arcade Physics engine.
